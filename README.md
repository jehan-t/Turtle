# Turtle Graphics Art Generator

This project is a Python program that uses the `turtle` module to create
randomized polygon art. The user can select from **1 to 9** different
art modes, and each mode generates shapes with random sizes, colors,
orientations, and locations. The project demonstrates object‑oriented
programming, randomization, and graphical output using Python.

## How the Program Works

The program defines a `Polygons` class that handles: - Randomizing
polygon attributes\
- Drawing single polygons\
- Drawing nested polygons\
- Creating multiple randomized shapes\
Each mode uses different settings to produce a unique style of artwork.

## Running the Program

1.  Install Python 3.\
2.  Run the script:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    python main.py

3.  Enter a number from **1--9** when prompted.\
4.  A turtle graphics window will display the generated art.\
5.  Take a screenshot and save it as **art1.jpg** to **art9.jpg**
    depending on the mode.\
6.  Commit your code file and all nine `.jpg` files to your GitHub
    repository.

## Art Mode Overview

-   **1** -- Triangle outlines\
-   **2** -- Square outlines\
-   **3** -- Pentagon outlines\
-   **4** -- Random-side outline polygons\
-   **5** -- Nested triangles\
-   **6** -- Nested squares\
-   **7** -- Nested pentagons\
-   **8** -- Random nested polygons\
-   **9** -- Mixed outline + nested shapes

## Submission Requirements

Your repository must include: - The Python program file\
- **Nine .jpg images** named correctly\
- A README file explaining program usage

## Project Status

All modes run correctly, and each produces randomized artwork that
matches the assignment requirements.
